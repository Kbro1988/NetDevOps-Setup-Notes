# NetDevOps-Setup-Notes

Collection of notes dedicated to my setup and journey into NetDevOps.

- These notes document my journey and may not accommodate your experience in every aspect.
  - My platform here was a Mac and most notes will reflect that. Moreover, I would highly recommend using a Mac or another Unix/Linux-based platform vs. Windows.
  - Open to feedback and updates to account for a more inclusive experience.
- There may be concepts on here that may not be 100%, as they were simply my interpretation during the process. Please let me know if there are any discrepancies I would be happy to clear things up.

## Order of Operations

Notes have been categorized into key topics. Based off that, this would be my recommended sequence to follow:

1. Preparing the Environment
2. Visual Studio Code
3. Getting Started with Git
4. Ansible
